# Learning Planner

Design structured learning paths for acquiring new skills or deepening knowledge.

## When to Use

- User wants to learn a new technology/skill
- User asks "how should I learn X?"
- User wants to plan skill development for a goal
- Preparing for a role that requires new skills

## Workflow

### 1. Clarify the Goal

Ask:
- **What:** Specific skill/topic?
- **Why:** Career goal? Project need? Interest? Build on existing skill?
- **Level:** Beginner to expert, or specific proficiency target?
- **Timeline:** Hard deadline or ongoing?
- **Constraints:** Hours per week available?

### 2. Assess Current State

From vault and system instructions:
- `Atlas/Focus/Polymath.md` — existing technical depth
- `Projects/` — related projects, what you've already built
- System instructions: You prefer depth, understanding *why*, learning by building
- Existing expertise to build on (don't duplicate)

### 3. Design the Path

Use `references/path-template.md` for structure:
- Phases (Foundations → Core → Applied → Advanced)
- Resources for each phase
- Practice exercises
- Milestones (how to know you're ready to move on)
- Projects that anchor learning

### 4. Curate Resources

Use `references/resource-guide.md` for evaluation:
- Official docs first (usually best)
- Hands-on courses second (if you learn kinesthetically)
- Books for deep understanding
- Videos for visual concepts
- Projects for integration

**Your preference:** Start with docs + theory, build early, go deeper if it matters

### 5. Set Success Criteria

Path should end with:
- "Can explain X without notes"
- "Can build Y without looking up basics"
- "Can evaluate Z objectively"
- Portfolio project to show what you've learned

## Principles

- **Just-in-time > Just-in-case** — Learn what you need for the next step
- **Build early** — Don't wait until you feel "ready"
- **Spaced repetition** — Plan review points, not just consumption
- **Output-focused** — Every phase should have tangible output
- **Depth > Breadth** — Go deep on what matters, skim what doesn't

## Red Flags

- No project or concrete outcome → too abstract
- No timeline or milestones → will drift
- All resources, no practice → passive learning
- Doesn't connect to existing knowledge → isolated learning
- Too ambitious for timeline → will burn out
