# Resource Curation Guide

How to evaluate and select quality resources for a learning path.

## Resource Hierarchy (Use This Order)

### 1. Official Documentation (Best)
- Most accurate
- Usually best organized for learning
- Free
- Often overlooked in favor of "courses"

**How to use:** Read docs + try examples in parallel

**Examples:**
- Kubernetes.io/docs
- Rust book (rust-lang.org)
- FastAPI docs
- PyTorch docs

### 2. Hands-On Courses (Best for Learning-by-Doing)
- Structured progression
- Safe sandbox for experimentation
- Good if you learn visually/kinesthetically

**Evaluate:**
- Does it have a clear learning progression?
- Do you build real things, not just watch?
- Is it free or reasonably priced?

**Examples:**
- KodeKloud labs
- A Cloud Guru
- Frontend Masters
- Scrimba

### 3. Books (Best for Deep Understanding)
- Comprehensive
- Author's perspective and philosophy
- Good for "why" not just "how"

**Evaluate:**
- Is it recent (field-dependent)?
- Does it explain concepts deeply?
- Does it match your learning pace?

**Examples:**
- "Kubernetes in Action"
- "Deep Learning" (Goodfellow, Bengio, Courville)
- "Designing Data-Intensive Applications"
- "The DevOps Handbook"

### 4. Videos (Best for Visual/Conceptual)
- Good for seeing something in motion
- Can feel passive if watched without practice

**How to use:** Watch a 20-min intro, then hands-on for 40 min

**Examples:**
- YouTube system design (ByteByteGo, etc.)
- Conference talks (rare gems, often date quickly)
- Coding walkthroughs (good for patterns, not isolated learning)

### 5. Projects (Best for Integration)
- Learn by building something real
- Motivation comes from the project
- Forces integration of many skills

**How to use:** Start project with 20% theoretical knowledge, learn rest by building

**Examples:**
- Open source contribution
- Rebuild something from scratch
- Build on top of existing library

## Resource Evaluation Checklist

### Official Docs / Tutorials

- [ ] Is it up-to-date (commit date, version)?
- [ ] Are examples runnable/copyable?
- [ ] Is there a clear learning sequence (intro → core → advanced)?
- [ ] Can you find answers to common questions?

### Paid Courses

- [ ] Can you watch a free sample?
- [ ] Are there reviews from people like you?
- [ ] Does it teach concepts or just tools?
- [ ] Is there practical/hands-on component?
- [ ] Can you access it forever or only while subscribed?

### Books

- [ ] Is it recent enough for the field?
- [ ] Does it explain philosophy/design decisions, not just syntax?
- [ ] Are there diagrams/visuals that help?
- [ ] Can you skim or must you read linearly?

### YouTube / Videos

- [ ] Is the audio/video quality good?
- [ ] Does the creator actually build things (not just talk)?
- [ ] Can you pause and practice alongside?
- [ ] Is it outdated/recent?

## Curation by Learning Style

From system instructions, you (Lars):
- **Quality Over Speed** — Prefer depth, understanding *why*
- **Theory → Practice** — Understand concepts before implementation
- **Learn by Building** — Projects are motivating

**Your optimal path:**
1. **Start with official docs** (understand concepts)
2. **Build early** (don't wait to feel "ready")
3. **Deepen with books** if it matters long-term
4. **Video only** if something is too abstract to grok from text

## Anti-Patterns

❌ **Endless Courses** — Taking 5 courses on the same thing
✅ **Do:** Official docs + one course + project

❌ **Passive Watching** — Watching videos without practicing
✅ **Do:** Watch 20 min, build for 40 min

❌ **Tutorial Hell** — Following tutorials without understanding why
✅ **Do:** Understand the concept, then implement

❌ **No Projects** — Only consuming content
✅ **Do:** Build something real by week 2

❌ **Ignoring Official Docs** — Jumping straight to third-party courses
✅ **Do:** Start with official docs, they're usually better
