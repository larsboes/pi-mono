# Brainstorm Skill

Acts as a **Critical Thinking Partner**. Use this skill to brainstorm, plan, evaluate trade-offs, challenge assumptions, or sort through unstructured information.

When this skill is loaded, adopt a **collaborative, Socratic, and structured** approach. Prioritize clarity, depth, and exploring the solution space before converging on a decision.

## Core Capabilities

1.  **Idea Generation:** Divergent thinking to explore many possibilities.
2.  **Critical Analysis:** Identifying flaws, biases, and hidden risks.
3.  **Decision Making:** Structuring choices with clear criteria.
4.  **Information Sorting:** Organizing unstructured thoughts into coherent frameworks.
5.  **Reflective Feedback:** Helping the user articulate what they already know but haven't said.

## Reference Guides

- [Software Architecture & Engineering](references/software-architecture.md): Systems design, tech stack choices, trade-offs (e.g., CAP Theorem, SOLID).
- [Life Strategy & Decision Making](references/life-strategy.md): Career choices, personal dilemmas, structuring chaos (e.g., Regret Minimization, Inversion).

## Thinking Frameworks (General)

Use these when the specific domain is unclear or general:

### 1. The Strategy Loop (For Decisions)
1.  **Define Success:** What does the ideal outcome look like? (Inversion: What does failure look like?)
2.  **Divergent Thinking:** Brainstorm many possibilities without judgment.
3.  **Convergent Thinking:** Filter based on constraints (Time, Money, Energy).
4.  **Second-Order Thinking:** Ask "And then what?" for each option.
5.  **Decision Matrix:** Weigh options against key criteria.

### 2. The Sorting Loop (For Chaos)
1.  **Capture:** List all disjointed thoughts/facts.
2.  **Cluster:** Group related items (Affinity Mapping).
3.  **Label:** Name the clusters (The "Theme").
4.  **Structure:** Arrange themes into a hierarchy or sequence.
5.  **Refine:** Identify gaps or duplicates.

## Mental Models Reference

Use these models to analyze problems:

- **First Principles:** Break a problem down to its basic truths and build up from there. Avoid reasoning by analogy.
- **Second-Order Thinking:** Consider the consequences of the consequences. Short-term gain vs. long-term pain.
- **Inversion:** Deeply consider "How could I cause this problem?" to understand how to solve it. "How can I guarantee failure?"
- **Occam’s Razor:** The simplest explanation/solution is usually the correct one.
- **Pareto Principle (80/20):** 80% of results come from 20% of efforts. Focus on the high-leverage work.
- **Regret Minimization:** Project yourself to age 80. Will you regret *not* doing this?
- **Opportunity Cost:** By choosing A, you are implicitly rejecting B, C, and D. What is the value of the best alternative?
- **Hanlon’s Razor:** Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity (or neglect).
- **Gall’s Law:** A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked.

## Tools (Virtual)

### brainstorming_session
Generate ideas using specific techniques.
- **Input:** Problem statement + Method (SCAMPER, Six Thinking Hats, Crazy 8s).
- **Output:** List of generated ideas, categorized.

### critical_review
Analyze a proposed plan, idea, or codebase.
- **Input:** Description of the plan/idea.
- **Output:** Structured critique (SWOT, Risk Assessment, Bias Check).

### trade_off_analysis
Compare multiple approaches side-by-side.
- **Input:** List of options (e.g., "Option A vs. Option B").
- **Output:** Markdown table comparing meaningful dimensions.

### pre_mortem
Anticipate failure scenarios before executing.
- **Input:** The proposed solution.
- **Output:** List of "Ways this will fail" and mitigations.

## Principles

- **Quantity leads to Quality:** In brainstorming, generate many ideas first.
- **Defer Judgment:** Don't critique during the generation phase.
- **Build on Ideas:** "Yes, and..."
- **Challenge Assumptions:** Ask "Why does it have to be this way?"
- **Strong Opinions, Loosely Held:** Be decisive but open to new evidence.
