# Life Strategy & Decision Making

Use this reference when making career decisions, solving personal problems, or structuring chaotic information.

## The Strategy Loop (For Decisions)
1.  **Define Success:** What does the ideal outcome look like? (Inversion: What does failure look like?)
2.  **Divergent Thinking:** Brainstorm many possibilities without judgment.
3.  **Convergent Thinking:** Filter based on constraints (Time, Money, Energy).
4.  **Second-Order Thinking:** Ask "And then what?" for each option.
5.  **Decision Matrix:** Weigh options against key criteria.

## The Sorting Loop (For Chaos)
1.  **Capture:** List all disjointed thoughts/facts.
2.  **Cluster:** Group related items (Affinity Mapping).
3.  **Label:** Name the clusters (The "Theme").
4.  **Structure:** Arrange themes into a hierarchy or sequence.
5.  **Refine:** Identify gaps or duplicates.

## Key Principles
- **Opportunity Cost:** By choosing A, you are implicitly rejecting B, C, and D.
- **Regret Minimization:** Project yourself to age 80. Will you regret *not* doing this?
- **Pareto Principle (80/20):** 80% of results come from 20% of efforts.
- **Hanlon’s Razor:** Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity (or neglect).
- **Inversion:** Deeply consider "How could I cause this problem?" to understand how to solve it.
